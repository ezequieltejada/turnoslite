# Turnos

Turnos is an app I've built using Angular 9.0.4 and Firebase.

The objective of this app is to apply what I've learned with this technologies and show a little glipse of what I can do.

## Multiple Firebase projects.

It has a custom script (handleFirebaseJSONFiles) that replaces firebase.json file depending if it deploys to prod or dev environments.
